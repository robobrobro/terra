terra [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robobrobro/terra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robobrobro/terra)
=====

JS library for cellular automata and simple biological simulations. Documentation and examples live [here](http://rileyjshaw.com/terra/).

## Hacking this library
To build terra on your machine you'll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed. Then...

```.bash
cd path/to/terra
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

## Contributing
At this stage **the most important way you can help is to use the library**. The API is in Beta and still flexible. If you discover something that's confusing or hard to work with, document it [here](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/terra/issues). Come up with an idea and try to build it; by using and testing the library you'll find bugs or usability issues that would otherwise go unnoticed.
If you want to make a pull-request on anything labeled 'major', be sure to join the discussion first so we can talk architecture.
If anyone's willing to get the ball rolling on [unit tests](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/terra/issues/16), [you will be my hero](http://youtu.be/koJlIGDImiU).


That's all, folks! MIT, remixing strongly encouraged.
